# Breath Doula: Final Project

## Thoughts on the Final

- All in all, it was a treat to build this website for my partner! I hope to continue to improve it over the summer by adding intended features
  - I wanted to add a lot more features to the site, however, my limited knowledge of nuxt and vue prevented me from doing so.
    - For example: I wanted to create a paralax hero section....that didn't work. Then I wanted to flip that cards on the service section...that also didn't pan out.
  - A valuable lesson was learned. I now know that I need to grasp more of the complex nuances of JavaScript before even attempting to learn how to implement them in nuxt or vue. Even further, to use them in React.
- As a result, over the summer, im going to take a Udemy course for JavaScript over the summer and hopefully this will help me advance in my career.
